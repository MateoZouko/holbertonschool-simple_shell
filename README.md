## Introduction
A simple shell is a basic command-line interface that allows users to interact with an operating system by executing commands. It functions as a command interpreter that takes user instructions and translates them into actions that the operating system can perform. Simple shells typically provide fundamental functionalities such as running programs, managing files and directories, displaying system information, and performing basic manipulation tasks. While lacking the advanced features found in more comprehensive shells, they play a fundamental role in providing a straightforward and efficient way to interact with a computer system through text-based command input.
